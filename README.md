# Sea Level Predictor

This project was completed as part of the freeCodeCamp **Data Analysis with Python** certification.

It uses historical data on global sea levels from 1880 to 2014 to:
- Visualize historical sea level rise
- Fit linear regression models
- Predict sea levels through the year 2050 based on two trendlines

## 📊 Key Tasks
- Imported and cleaned data using **pandas**
- Plotted sea level data using **matplotlib**
- Used `scipy.stats.linregress` to calculate two trendlines:
  - Full historical trend (1880–2014)
  - Recent trend (2000–2014)
- Projected both trends to the year **2050**

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python sea_level_predictor.py
